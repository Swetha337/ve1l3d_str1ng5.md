By arranging them in a sequential order we will get the flag. <br/>
WHAT I LEARNED: <br/>
Based on the output we receive we understand which input are correct and incorrect <br/>
I also gained practical hands on hands experience with microcontrollers  and serial comunications. <br/> 
Also learned to set up puTTY to establish a serial connection with microcontrollers. <br/>
